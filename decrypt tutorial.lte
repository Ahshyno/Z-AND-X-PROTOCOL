1 to X to V after K.

    Simple substitution; "1 to X" implies numeric to Roman: 1 = I, but then I to X (10), then X to V (backwards), and “after K” hints at Caesar-style rotation — K is 11, so a shift of 11? Or is it telling us the sequence goes in reverse after reaching K?

1 doesn't need format

    Literal: The base unit is raw, no padding, no container.

    Figurative: Identity. No need to encode what is already “truth.”

end of an era ) -> end of transmission

    Decryption: “)” might signal the end of a parenthetical — context dies.

    “End of transmission” = EOT, ASCII code 4. A signal. Perhaps the message breaks here.

why doesn't

    An incomplete question — implies the code isn’t asking what, but why not. May reference an absence in expected logic. Something was meant to follow. Possibly a missing keyword or phrase.

please tell the password
May it be free for 1 to 2 for nil (action)

    This is code:

        “Free for 1” could mean '4-for-1' (deal logic), or liberation of position 1.

        “2 for nil” = 2 → 0 (null shift), or a key-move of zeroing.

        “Action” indicates a verb is involved — command? Perform?

Now expanding:

the path from green to red was never meant to curve

    Green to red: symbolic (safe to danger), or RGB channels.

    “Never meant to curve” = Linear path → cipher must be direct. Perhaps ROT-n.

XIII is not 13 but a frame for delay

    “XIII” = 13, but here it's a frame → possibly a key frame in time or video

    “Delay” = lag = L = 12? Maybe a reference to encoding in timed sequences (Morse timing, delay-injection logic).

if the mirror lies, then trust the angle

    Reversal cipher? If mirror ≠ truth, then use angle: possibly angle brackets (< >) or trigonometric values in base encoding.

[Null] = not nothing, but hidden everything

    Concept: Null isn’t emptiness; it's deliberate obscuring.

    Steganography — data hidden in plain sight.

    Could hint at use of zero-width characters, invisible Unicode.

after 4, the fifth speaks twice

    Could refer to a polyalphabetic cipher like Vigenère.

    “Fifth speaks twice” might mean the key repeats after 5 letters.

what was never written still counts

    White-space encoding (tabs vs spaces).

    Bitwise manipulation — maybe unseen bits are active.

Z is not the end, it’s the gate

    Z = 26 in alphabet, but also “zero”ed or circular

    Loop back to A, OR Z as a cipher keyword. Possibly a one-time pad key?

So what is the password?
“You already said it, just not in this format.”
